## 🎯 What is this?

**Reflect** is a revolutionary **self-learning AI system** for Claude Code that enables **automatic skill improvement** through user corrections. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that forget everything between sessions, Reflect creates **permanent learning** from your feedback.

**Perfect for:** Developers, AI engineers, automation enthusiasts, teams using Claude Code, anyone tired of repeating corrections to AI assistants.

**Use Cases:**
- 🔧 **Development workflows** - Teach Claude your preferred tools (uv, pytest, ruff)
- 🎨 **Code style** - Enforce your coding standards automatically
- 📦 **Project templates** - Remember your preferred project structures
- 🔐 **Security practices** - Never forget security checks again
- 🚀 **CI/CD pipelines** - Consistent deployment patterns

### The Problem

```
Session 1: Claude uses pip
You:      "No, use uv instead"
Claude:   "Ok, using uv"

Session 2: Claude uses pip again 😞
You:      "I told you to use uv!"
```

### The Solution

```
Session 1: Claude uses pip
You:      "No, use uv instead"
          → /reflect → Skill learns ✅

Session 2: Claude uses uv ✨
Session 3: Claude uses uv ✨
Forever:  Claude uses uv ✨
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Copy to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r reflect ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r python-project-creator ~/.claude/skills/

# Check status
/reflect-status
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Work with Claude** - Let it make a mistake
2. **Correct it** - "No, use X instead of Y"
3. **Run reflection** - `/reflect`
4. **Review changes** - Approve with `A`
5. **Done!** - Claude learned permanently

### Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/reflect` | Analyze current session manually |
| `/reflect-on` | Enable auto-reflection at session end |
| `/reflect-off` | Disable auto-reflection |
| `/reflect-status` | Show current configuration |

---

## 📦 What's Included

### 🧠 Reflect System

The core learning engine with:

- ✅ Pattern detection (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence)
- ✅ Safe skill updates with backups
- ✅ Git integration for version control
- ✅ Interactive review flow
- ✅ Auto-reflection via hooks

**📖 [Complete User Guide](reflect/USER_GUIDE.md)**

### 🐍 Python Project Creator (Demo)

Example skill that demonstrates learning:

**Initial state:** Uses `pip` and `unittest`

**After corrections:**
1. ✅ Learned: Use `uv` instead of `pip`
2. ✅ Learned: Always `pytest`, never `unittest`

**Result:** Now always suggests `uv` and `pytest`!

---

## 🎓 How It Works

### Three Confidence Levels

#### 🔴 HIGH - Corrections
```
"No, use X instead of Y"
"Never do X"
"Always check Y"
```
→ Creates **Critical Corrections** section

#### 🟡 MEDIUM - Approvals
```
"Yes, perfect!"
"That works well"
"Exactly right"
```
→ Adds to **Best Practices**

#### 🟢 LOW - Observations
```
"Have you considered...?"
"What about...?"
```
→ Notes in **Considerations**

### Safe Application

Every change includes:
- ✅ Timestamped backup
- ✅ YAML validation
- ✅ User approval (manual mode)
- ✅ Automatic rollback on errors
- ✅ Git commit with description

---

## 📖 Example Learning Journey

### Step 1: Initial Mistake

Claude uses `pip install`:
```bash
pip install fastapi
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Your Correction

> "No, use uv instead of pip! It's faster and modern."

### Step 3: Reflection Detects

```
Signal detected:
- Type: HIGH confidence correction
- Pattern: "use X instead of Y"
- Old: pip
- New: uv
```

### Step 4: Skill Updated

```diff
+## Critical Corrections
+
+**Use 'uv' instead of 'pip'**
+- ✗ Don't: pip install
+- ✓ Do: uv pip install
```

### Step 5: Forever Learned

Next session, Claude automatically:
```bash
uv pip install fastapi
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**No reminder needed!** ✨

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Manual Mode (Recommended for beginners)

```bash
/reflect-status  # Should show "Disabled"
```

Run `/reflect` after sessions with corrections.

### Auto Mode (For continuous learning)

```bash
/reflect-on
```

Runs automatically at session end via Stop hook.

### Hook Setup

Already configured if you copied the skills! Check:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.local.json | grep -A 5 hooks
```

Should show hook for `reflect/scripts/hook-stop.sh`.

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ Do

- Start with manual `/reflect` to learn the system
- Be specific: "Use X instead of Y"
- Review diffs before approving
- Check git history regularly
- Enable auto-mode after you trust it

### ❌ Don't

- Be vague: "That's wrong" (won't detect)
- Contradict yourself: Creates conflicts
- Skip reviews: Always check changes
- Delete backups: They save you!

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

### Demo Workflow

```bash
# 1. Ask Claude to create a Python project
"Create a Python FastAPI project"

# 2. Claude uses pip (as currently documented)
# 3. Correct it:
"No, always use uv instead of pip!"

# 4. Run reflection:
/reflect

# 5. Review and approve the changes

# 6. Next time, Claude automatically uses uv!
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: Does this work with other AI coding assistants?**  
A: Currently designed for Claude Code CLI, but the pattern detection logic can be adapted to other LLM-based tools.

**Q: Will this slow down Claude Code?**  
A: No! Reflection runs either manually or in background. Zero impact on normal usage.

**Q: Can I use this in a team?**  
A: Yes! Share skills via Git. Team members can sync learnings and build collective knowledge.

**Q: Is my data sent anywhere?**  
A: No! Everything stays 100% local on your machine. Privacy guaranteed.

**Q: How much disk space does it use?**  
A: Minimal - typically <1MB for the system + ~5KB per skill update.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What Python version do I need?**  
A: Python 3.8 or higher. Check with `python3 --version`

**Q: Can I customize the pattern detection?**  
A: Yes! Edit `reflect/scripts/extract_signals.py` to add custom patterns.

**Q: How do backups work?**  
A: Every change creates a timestamped backup in `~/.claude/skills/{skill}/.backups/`. Auto-cleaned after 30 days.

**Q: What if reflection makes a mistake?**  
A: Review every change before approval (manual mode), or rollback via Git: `git revert HEAD`

**Q: Can I disable learning for specific skills?**  
A: Yes! Edit `extract_signals.py` and add skill to `EXCLUDED_SKILLS` list.

### Usage Questions

**Q: When should I use manual vs auto reflection?**  
A: Start with manual (`/reflect`) to learn the system. Enable auto (`/reflect-on`) after ~1 week when you trust it.

**Q: How do I see what was learned?**  
A: Check Git history: `cd ~/.claude/skills && git log --grep="reflection"`

**Q: Can I undo a learning?**  
A: Yes! Restore from backup or use `git revert`

**Q: What's the difference between HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence?**  
A: HIGH = explicit corrections, MEDIUM = approvals, LOW = suggestions. See [USER_GUIDE.md](reflect/USER_GUIDE.md#confidence-levels-erklärt)
